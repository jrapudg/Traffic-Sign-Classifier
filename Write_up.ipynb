    "### Writeup / README\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one. You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf. You can use this template as a guide for writing the report. The submission includes the project code.\n",

    "### Data Set Summary & Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing how the data is distributed in the training set, validation set and test set. It can be observed that there is not a uniform distribution among the classes of the data of the different sets. \n",

    "### Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because it reduces the data set and simpiflies the calculations to just one channel that contains the avarage of all the information of the three channels. \n",

    "![alt text][image2.2]\n",
    "As a last step, I normalized the image data because the imnages should be at a comparable range.\n",
    "I decided to generate additional data because there are just few images from several labels. To get a better performance of the network, it is adviceble to have a uniform distribution of the classes in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add more data to the the data set, I used the following techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "I randomly rotated in the range of (-10,10) degrees, scaled by (-10%,10%) and shifted by (-1,1) pixels in order to get more variety in the data set. I set to 2,500 images the size of the data set for each class. Totally, I got 110,000 images.\n",

    "#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the model, I used a batch size of 100 and 50 epochs. The model performed better with a low learning rate and after several trials, I set it to be 0.0009. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model results were:\n",
    "* training set accuracy of ? \n",
    "98%\n",
    "* validation set accuracy of ?  \n",
    "95.7%\n",
    "* test set accuracy of ? \n",
    "93.3%\n",
    "\n",
    "If an iterative approach was chosen:\n",
    "* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?\n",
    "First, I decided to used the Lenet architecture used in the previuos lesson but for a RGB input. I chose it because it was familiar to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There was overfitting and the validation set accuracy was 80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.\n",
    "* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I converted the images to grayscale and reduce the input channel to just one. Then, for regularization, I used the dropout technique only in the convolutional layers setting the keep_prob parameter to 0.75. I also reduced the batch size from 128 to 100 getting a better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?\n",
    "Grayscaling was the first important design choice. While reducing the input channels and keeping the important information by averaging improved the accuracy of the model from 80% to 90%. Normalizing the images aldo helped a lot to set the data to a comparable range. Undoubtly pre-processing is a relevant step for training a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, by using dropout in the convolutional layers, it helped the network to not to memorize the data set and prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a well known architecture was chosen:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What architecture was chosen? \n",
    "Lenet\n",
    "* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application? \n",
    "Because it has proven a good performance classifying images. In a first step, the convolutional layers scanned the image with a window looking for features. Then, the fully-connected layers helped to narrow the data to the 43 classes of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well? \n",
    "Because the accuracy is higher than 93% and the model was tested with 5 images from Internet that it has never \"seen\" and proved to get 100% accuracy. \n",
